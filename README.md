# RNAmut
## Description
To gain a better understanding of tumor heterogeneity, it is important to reliably detect cell-level mutations. This can be done using single cell DNA data https://github.com/cbg-ethz/SCITE. Based on this work, but with focus on RNA instead of DNA data, RNAmut aims to determine single cell mutations from alternative and reference allele read counts. Using RNA in addition to DNA data might lead to a more reliable mutation detection.
Two read count files were extracted from single-cell RNA sequencing data by following the steps in section 5 https://github.com/nghiavtr/SCmut. 
These files serving as example can be found in the [*Data*](https://github.com/znorio/RNAmut/tree/master/Data) folder.
