# RNAmut
## Introduction
To gain a better understanding of tumor heterogeneity, it is necessary to detect cell-level mutations. This can be done using single cell DNA data https://github.com/cbg-ethz/SCITE. Based on their work this code aims to determine single cell mutations from alternative and reference RNA read counts. Using RNA in addition to DNA data might lead to more robust results. The example single-cell RNA sequencing data was extracted by following the steps from https://github.com/nghiavtr/SCmut section 5.
